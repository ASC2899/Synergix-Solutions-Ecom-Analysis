## üìå Problem Statements, Solution approach and Key Findings

**‚ùì Synergix Has Been Aggressively Channeling Their Resources Into Online Marketing to attract more users to their e-commerce portal. Now, after a period of rigorous marketing, one crucial question looms large at Synergix:**

**"_Was The Online Marketing Investment Worth It?_"**

üîç To answer this, we begin by visualizing **Total Online Spend** and **Total Revenue** over time using the **Date** column from the [Calendar Table](#-table-relation-model-and-creating-calendar-table). We remove the **Day** level from the hierarchy to get a **monthly view across two years**.

üí° As you can see It's evident that as **online marketing spend** increases, there‚Äôs a **parallel rise in monthly revenue** over time.

![Q1](Assets/Q1.png)

To understand **what‚Äôs driving this revenue growth**, we break down its two components:  
- **Units Sold**
- **Price Per Unit**

Next, we visualize **Average Unit Price** (from POS Data) against Dates from the [Calendar Table](#-table-relation-model-and-creating-calendar-table), again removing the Day level to view monthly trends.

üí° This clearly shows that **Synergix has steadily increased unit prices over time**, which is **likely the primary driver** behind the rising revenue.

![Q1.1](Assets/Q1.1.png)

To verify whether **units sold** also contributed to revenue growth, we compare **Total Units Sold** and **Total Online Spend** over time using a **Line and Clustered Column Chart**.

üí° The result shows that while **online marketing expenses nearly doubled** over two years, there has been **no significant increase in units sold**. This confirms that **the revenue growth is primarily due to the increased unit price**.

![Q1.2](Assets/Q1.2.png)

üí° However, here‚Äôs an **interesting insight**: Despite the **higher unit price**, **product demand has not declined**. This may suggest that the **increased online marketing spend helped sustain demand**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Still, from a **business sustainability** perspective, relying **solely on higher pricing** ‚Äî without growing the **customer base or sales volume** ‚Äî is a **risky and short-sighted strategy**.

**‚ùì Synergix is looking to understand how web traffic is influencing product sales. As part of their digital growth objectives, they‚Äôve set a target to increase web traffic by 10%. The team now wants to analyze the relationship between traffic volume and units sold, and evaluate whether they are on track to meet this goal.**.

üîç To tackle with this question, we have to plot **Total Web Traffic** and **Total Units Sold** over time using a **Line and Clustered Column Chart**.  
Make sure to **remove the Quarter and Day levels** from the Date hierarchy for a cleaner, monthly view.

üí° The analysis reveals a **moderately positive relationship** between **Web Traffic** and **Units Sold**.  
We can clearly observe that **spikes in web traffic correlate with increases in unit sales**.

![Q2](Assets/Q2.png)


For tracking the **traffic target**, we create a **KPI card**. But before that, we define two DAX measures:  
- **Web Traffic Latest Month**  
- **Web Traffic Target**

You can find the DAX logic for these measures in the [üõ†Ô∏è DAX](#dax) section.

**‚ùì The marketing team at Synergix wants to evaluate the performance of their online advertising campaigns. Specifically, they are interested in tracking the Click-Through Rate (CTR) over time and assessing whether they are progressing toward a new strategic goal of increasing CTR by 5%.**.

üîç To begin, we first need to create the following DAX measures:  
- **Total Online Clicks**  
- **Total Online Impressions**

Then, using these two, we calculate the **Online CTR** measure.

Next, we create an **Area Chart** with **Online CTR** on the Y-axis and **Dates** from the [Calendar Table](#-table-relation-model-and-creating-calendar-table) on the X-axis.

üí° The chart reveals some **concerning insights** ‚Äî even at their **peak performance in September 2022**, Synergix only achieved a **CTR of 0.74%**, which is **way below industry averages** which is about 1%-2%.

From earlier analysis, we already know that **marketing spend has been increasing**, yet this visualization confirms that **Online CTR hasn‚Äôt significantly improved** over time.

üìà Another notable observation:  
There are **certain months where CTR spikes**, indicating the online ads were **particularly compelling**.  
However, **other months show dips**, suggesting inconsistency in ad effectiveness.  
This highlights the need for the **marketing team to actively monitor CTR performance** and establish a **target benchmark**.

![Q3](Assets/Q3.png)

To track the **CTR target**, we create a **KPI card** using two more DAX measures:  
- **CTR Latest Month**  
- **CTR Target**

You can find the DAX logic for these measures in the [üõ†Ô∏è DAX](#dax) section.

**‚ùì  As part of its cost optimization strategy, Synergix has set a goal to reduce its Cost Per Click (CPC) for online advertising by 2%. The marketing team wants to monitor CPC trends over time and evaluate whether this cost-efficiency target is being achieved.**

üîç To proceed with this analysis, we first need to create a measure, **Online CPC** (Cost Per Click).  
Next, we plot an **Area Chart** using **Online CPC** over time, removing the **Day level** from the Dates hierarchy in the [**Calendar Table**](#-table-relation-model-and-creating-calendar-table).

üí° The visualization reveals that **CPC values fluctuate month-to-month** ‚Äî with certain months showing **spikes**, while others show **dips**.  
- A **high CPC** indicates that Synergix paid more per click, possibly due to **increased competition** or **lower ad relevance**, making **customer acquisition more expensive**.  
- A **low CPC** means the company achieved **more efficient ad spending**, gaining more value for the same cost.

üìâ Despite these fluctuations, there is **no clear long-term upward or downward trend** in CPC.

![Q4](Assets/Q4.png)

To gain deeper insight, we overlay the **Online CTR** measure on the **secondary Y-axis** of the same chart.

üí° This reveals an **inconsistent relationship** between **CPC and CTR**.  
However, a **noteworthy observation** is that in **January and February 2022**, **CTR peaked while CPC dropped** ‚Äî indicating **high-performing, cost-effective ad campaigns**.

üìå This insight can help the marketing team **reverse-engineer successful strategies** from those months and apply them to future campaigns.

![Q4.1](Assets/Q4.1.png)

To evaluate whether Synergix is moving toward its **2% CPC reduction target**, we create a **KPI card** using these DAX measures:
- **CPC Latest Month**
- **CPC Target**

You can find the logic for these measures in the [**üõ†Ô∏è DAX**](#dax) section.

üìä Since **lower CPC is favorable**, be sure to configure the KPI card appropriately:  
- Under **Visual Format > Trend Axis**, set **Direction = Low is Good**  
- Set **Distance Direction = Increasing is Positive** to accurately reflect performance.

CALCULATE(
    [Online CPC],
    PREVIOUSMONTH('Calendar Table'[Date])
) * 0.98
```


## üîó Table Relation Model and Creating Calendar Table

Before proceeding with any steps in this project, it is **mandatory to create a Calendar Table** in Power BI. This table acts as a central reference for all time-based analysis and relationships across the data model.

Since multiple tables in this dataset contain date fields (e.g., POS data, media campaigns, product activity), a dedicated Calendar Table ensures:
- Consistent and accurate date filtering
- Enables Time Intelligence functions
- Simplifies relationships across fact tables

üëâ **Use the following DAX formula in Power BI to create the Calendar Table:**

```
Calendar Table =
VAR StartYear = 2021
VAR EndYear = 2022
RETURN
    ADDCOLUMNS (
        CALENDAR ( DATE ( StartYear, 1, 1 ), DATE ( EndYear, 12, 31 ) ),
        "Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
        "Month No.", MONTH ( [Date] ),
        "Day", DAY ( [Date] ),
        "Day Name", FORMAT ( [Date], "DDDD" ),
        "Day Name Short", FORMAT ( [Date], "DDD" ),
        "Month Name", FORMAT ( [Date], "MMMM" ),
        "Month Name Short", FORMAT ( [Date], "MMM" ),
        "Quarter", QUARTER ( [Date] ),
        "Quarter Name", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ),
        "Week of Year", WEEKNUM ( [Date] )
    )
```
After creating the Calendar Table, you must establish relationships between the Calendar Table and every other table that contains a Date column.
Once all relationships are built correctly, your model should look similar to [this](./Assets/Table_Relation_Model.png).
