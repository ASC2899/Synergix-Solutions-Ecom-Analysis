## üîó Table Relation Model

Before proceeding with any steps in this project, it is **mandatory to create a Calendar Table** in Power BI. This table acts as a central reference for all time-based analysis and relationships across the data model.

Since multiple tables in this dataset contain date fields (e.g., POS data, media campaigns, product activity), a dedicated Calendar Table ensures:
- Consistent and accurate date filtering
- Enables Time Intelligence functions
- Simplifies relationships across fact tables

üëâ **Use the following DAX formula in Power BI to create the Calendar Table:**

```
Calendar Table =
VAR StartYear = 2021
VAR EndYear = 2022
RETURN
    ADDCOLUMNS (
        CALENDAR ( DATE ( StartYear, 1, 1 ), DATE ( EndYear, 12, 31 ) ),
        "Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
        "Month No.", MONTH ( [Date] ),
        "Day", DAY ( [Date] ),
        "Day Name", FORMAT ( [Date], "DDDD" ),
        "Day Name Short", FORMAT ( [Date], "DDD" ),
        "Month Name", FORMAT ( [Date], "MMMM" ),
        "Month Name Short", FORMAT ( [Date], "MMM" ),
        "Quarter", QUARTER ( [Date] ),
        "Quarter Name", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ),
        "Week of Year", WEEKNUM ( [Date] )
    )
```
After creating the Calendar Table, you must establish relationships between the Calendar Table and every other table that contains a Date column.
Once all relationships are built correctly, your model should look similar to [this](Synergix-Solutions-Ecom-Analysis/Assets/Table_Relation_Model.png).
